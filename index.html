  <p>This home page represents a very basic homepage in Github pages using best practices for HTML5 coding with a very simple but robust CSS style sheet to stat from (generiously made publis by Tom Hodgins through his <a href="https://gist.github.com/tomhodgins/e330ec1826d1cde2b8b0" alt="link to Tom Hodgins Github" target="_blank">Github Repository</a>). Tom has also set up <a href="https://codepen.io/tomhodgins/pen/appyXa" alt="link to HTML5 testing page" target="_blank">a web tool where you can live edit HTML and CSS in the same window while also viewing the results instantaniously within the same browser window</a>. This tool is extremely helpful in teaching yourself new ideas without breaking your own site.</p>
  <p>I have put together a series of additional pages linked below with basic coding tips, tricks, and cheatsheets to be used as you wish:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic HTML tags to know and use regularly</li>
      <li>Intermediate HTML tags to use once you feel comfortable with the basics</li>
      <li>If you want to use Github Markdown, this is a small collection of similar tags and tips to those items I deonstrate in HTML</li>
